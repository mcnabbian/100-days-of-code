# 100 Days Of Code - Log

*I basically started this challenge almost 3 weeks ago, but I figured I would just 'restart' because it would be nice to have a daily log of progress to look back on. In addition to the time of spent learning, I've created a jupyter notebook available [HERE](https://github.com/mcnabbian/cuttlefish).*

### Day 1: March 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began learning SQL. Learned about relational databases and how to make some basic queries. Also learned what it means to clone a repository and what a 'remote' is in relation to git.

**Thoughts**: SQL seems like a really easy way to explore (filter, groupby, etc.) a dataset. I'm excited to complete the intro SQL course and start digging into some interesting data. I started off using 'brute force', like iterating through each row of a dataset, building lists/dictionaries, etc. That was pretty aweful and clearly inefficient when it comes to big data. I then learned how to utilize Pandas and NumPy libraries. That was much much better but still had a bit of a steep learning curve. By no means have I mastered it, but I understand how pandas dataframes are structured, how to use indexes to filter out data, how to relate two or more columns to each other, how to use the describe method to quickly get basic statistics, etc. I'm excited to see what can be done using SQL. Honestly it seems a lot more straightforward, so maybe I won't have to bang my head against the wall quite as much.

### Day 2: March 6, 2020

**Notes:**
- SQL; types of joins

**Today's Progress**: Progressed in SQL course. Learned how to limit and offset results. More importantly, learned several
different kinds of joins.

**Thoughts**: Spent a bit of time stuck on a left join problem; turns out I was writing the column name
incorrectly woooo. Classic. Slow day, working through tutorials isn't particularly interesting, but probably best to understand the basics.

### Day 3: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use aggregates (functions) in a SQL select query. Also learned how to filter out NULL values from my results.

**Thoughts**: It's saturday and it's sunny and I'm hungry but you know what; my hour is complete. Working through this tutorial is dreadfully boring, bur necessary.
